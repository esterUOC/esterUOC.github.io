Our primary tool for writing programs in C++ will be the use of the Visual Studio 2022 software.
This tutorial covers the Windows operating system, as it is one of the most widely used
operating systems in the video game industry, ifuse Mac or Linux link the following videos:

It is true that we could use any text editor to write our code in C++, and once written, pass it
through a compiler to generate an executable binary, which they can execute finally. But our
choice for the IDE (integrated development environment) Visual Studio 2022 is because this
software brings together a group of tools that will help us write and debug our code.
As its official page says: “In addition to code editing, the Visual Studio IDE brings together
graphic designers, compilers, code completion tools, source code control, extensions and many
more features in one place.”

## Download and installation of the VS 2022

We will go to the [link](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), and follow the next instructions:

When the Download web page of the VisualStudio has download:

We will select the option "Community 2022" which is free for everyone.

Clicking this button will download an executable: the VisualStudioSetup.exe, this executable will
install the VisualStudioInstaller or VSI.

Once we have the VSI running, in the "Available" tab we will see that we have the optionto
install el VS Community 2022. Clickinstall and we will wait for a while, it usually takes its time…
Next we will have to configure which components we want to install, for us we will only need to
click on the options of:
- Desktop developent with C++
- (opcional) .Net desktop development i Universal Windows Platform development

Once VS is installed we can launch the application, we recommend you register using your
Microsoft username and password.
From now on we will be able to configure some things in the application.
1. Dark mode: if we want the "dark mode" instead of the one used by default, we will go to
Tools->Options, in the "General" tab, choose the Dark mode.
To create a new solution go to File->New Project, here we will select C++ in the "Languages"
tab, and from here we can select "Empty project".

You can save the new project wherever you want, I recommend creating a specific folder for
each project.
It is recommended not to name thesolutions nor to projects that contain spaces. As you have
seen, VS contains solutions and projects, we can say that a solution is like a group of projects
related to each other, where the solution is like a workbench where all the projects are
concentrated.
And every project isessentially a set of files which we can compile and create an executable, a
static or dynamic library etc etc
We recommend the Visual Assist plugin, it is paid but highly recommended.
