It is true that we could use any text editor to write our code in C++, and once written, pass it
through a compiler to generate an executable binary, whichthey can execute finally But our
choice for the IDE (integrated development environment) Visual Studio 2022 is because this
software brings together a group of tools that will help us write and debug our code.
As its official page says: “In addition to code editing, the Visual Studio IDE brings together
graphic designers, compilers, code completion tools, source code control, extensions and many
more features in one place.”
