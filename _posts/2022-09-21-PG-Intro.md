Hello everyone,

we welcome you to this Computer Graphics course. We propose you to learn how to create small video games without relying on an engine such as Unity or Unreal, both very popular game engines used in the development of video games both at an educational and professional level. This will allow us to see how everything works internally. As a developer, this is incredibly useful in order to have a degree of technological independence in our projects, and surpass any limitations of commercial engines.

At the beginning of the course, we will briefly rely on the RaylibLinks to an external site. library, developed with a clearly educational objective (but also with several commercial tools available and Google OpenSource awardsLinks to an external site.) to facilitate the understanding of all the basic concepts. Then, we will quickly move to OpenGL, a very well-known graphical library widely adopted by the industry. This two-step process is very important, since OpenGL is a very complex graphic system, with a quite steep learning curve. Indeed, Raylib was created for this very reason, so you will see that taking things a bit slowly will pay off at the end.

I encourage you to start working from this moment!
